# Threat Detection with YOLO v5

This project aims to detect threats using a custom dataset trained on faces of individuals using YOLO v5, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The model is designed to identify potential threats based on facial recognition and object detection techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of annotated images of individuals, focusing on facial features relevant to threat detection scenarios. It includes various poses, lighting conditions, and environments to ensure robust model training.

## YOLO v5 Model

The model architecture used is YOLO v5, a deep learning-based real-time object detection system. YOLO v5 is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects, including faces, which is crucial for threat detection applications.

## Setup

### Installation
